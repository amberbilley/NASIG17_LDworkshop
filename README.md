Foundations in Linked Data for Serialists
 
Are you baffled by BIBFRAME? Overwhelmed by ontologies? Or feeling turmoil about Turtle? Then this workshop is for you. Learn the practical foundations of Linked Data with a particular focus on serials in this half-day workshop. The presenters will go beyond just talking about RDF triples and actually break down linked data technology and how its application can be utilized for serials. Topics to be covered:
 
Linked Data 101
Ontology Basics
Turtle Tutorial
BIBFRAME 2.0 Introduction and the CONSER Mapping
 
Attendees are strongly encouraged to bring a laptop. The presenters will be demonstrating linked data tools such as Protege, Vitro, and the LC BIBFRAME Editor (hopefully ready for BF 2.0). Attendees will have the opportunity to try the software along with the demonstration.
